1.WAP a number getting from subtracting the largest num and smallest num from given digits.Generate sequence like this.
1729 - num
9721 - 1279 = 8442
8442 - 2448 = 5994
i need a sequence like this 1729 8442 5994 and so on as output 

* Correct, Readable, Changable, Testable

2.Collatz senquence
   160,80,40,20,10,5,16,8,4,2,1,4,2,1.....
   
3.amount rounded to the nearest 5 rupee amount
  Ex: 42 rupees 73 paise = 45
  
4.Write function that computes the digital root of a given integer
5.Write function to check whether given num is power of 2 or not.
6.Given an integer return the largest power of 2 from collatz sequence.
7.Passcode Derivation prbm - in Project Euler
